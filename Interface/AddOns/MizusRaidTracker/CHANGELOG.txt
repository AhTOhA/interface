    * Added Cataclysm raid zone names and boss IDs
    * Added option to use a trigger for the guild attendance check instead of the character name
    * Added basic chat filtering. MRT will now supress any whispers, which are handled by the guild attendance check. MRT will print a status message, when anyone added someone as a boss attendee. This should reduce whisper spam and make MRT compatible with WIM.
    * Added UI button for starting a guild attendance check. (Same effect as '/mrt dkpcheck')
    * Added new slash command '/mrt deleteall now' for deleting the raid log. (Use with caution - there is no extra "Are you sure?"-dialog)

    * MRT now supports data exports of a running raid.
  Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed a lua-error which occured at the very last part of the Lich King fight. Because of that, the kill detection for the Iron Council (Stellbraker last) is deactivated once again, because both bosses use the same emote. This will be fixed in the next release. Hopefully. (Ticket ID 13)

  New:
    * Added support and a complete UI translation for spanish (esES) clients (a big thanks to Hestrall, who translated 90% of the addon).

    * Added a LibDataBroker data source for opening the raidlog and the options panel
  Changes:
    * 'Add Bosskill' dialog: Deleted the user dialog, which asked, if raid attendees should be copied to the boss attendees list. This is now done by default. Since raid attendee data takes priority over boss attendee data since v0.17, having this optional didn't make sense anymore.
    * Updated deDE translation.

0.17 Beta - Changelog:
  New:
    * Added option for disabling boss based attendee data for CTRT-export (if you only create one raid entry for each raid in your EQDKP(-Plus) and make corrections to raid members manually, you might want to activate this option)
    * Added checks to prevent exporting of an active raid (raid data is incomplete until a raid is finished)
    * Added option for disabling the confirmation box for an attendance check.

    * In 10/25 raids, players moved in groups >2/>5 are now treated as leaving players, if "Track only first 2/5 groups" is enabled.

    * Changed localization files for supporting the CurseForge localization system.
  Bug Fixes:
    * Fixed boss detection of the horde gunship battle (ICC - untested)
    

0.15 Beta - Changelog:
  New:
    * Added two new export formats: plain text and BBCode formatted text (choose your export format in the options panel)
    * Added new option panel for export options
    * CTRT-Export: Added option for automatically adding one item of poor item quality to each boss at data export. This should fix a bug in the EQDKP-CTRT-Import-Plugin boss detection. Boss detection fails, if no loot is connected to a boss event (i.e. attendance checks).
