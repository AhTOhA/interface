Description
	- Class (In BG), Level, Guild (world)
	- Colored by reaction
	- Enemy Players: Guild colored Reddish
	- Friendly Players: Guild colored Bluish
	


Un-id'd friendly and hostile are greyish versions of the 'normal' colors
turn off CPU polling

Solve problems, not add meaningless features

* Problem Solved:
	In-combat filtering
	
* Quatre/Damage, Namer

* UnitCache
	* PLAYER Entering world
		- Check if BG/instance or whatever, and turn off general polling if it is
		- only poll in world

* debuff widget
	* poll for recycle?
	* or, capture some event, like getting on a mount
	*combat log event
	
	or use SetAuraInstance...
	create ClearAuraInstance to clear removed auras
	watch for unitdied events in the combat log, and clear those guids
		- UNIT_DIED	 destGUID and destName refer to the unit that died.
		- that won't clear many npc infos, but it might be ok.
		- I think that the current structure of clearing after combat should work fine.  who doesn't engage in combat?

NOTES
---------------------
Tank Hex Color: 3782D1
Damage Hex Color: FF4400


6.1 Revisions
................................................................................................................................

6.1.3	- Welcome 
6.1.4	- Colors reset, Welcome fix
6.1.5	- Raid Tank Coloring for "By Threat" Modes
		- Alphabetized List
		- Better handling when previous theme selection does not exist
		- Debuffs of the same spell-id are now handled more securely
		
6.1.6
		- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE
		- Added Threat Wheel to Hub
		- Reverted to original health % mode (does not show % when full health)
		- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (works on 4.0.x and 4.1)
	

6.1.7
	- Changed from thousand/million suffix for health text to using a thousands seperator
	- Restored PTR support (last time I checked)
	- Moved Quatre Raid Icon to similar position as Neon (to left side of health bar)
	
6.1.8
	- PTR bug fixes (Neon Threat Glow was turning green)
	- Debuff widget will clear aurainstance tables when combat ends (regen returns)
	- Added Health Text option: Approximate Health (will show 2 decimal places for thousands (k) and millions (M), with suffix)
	- Added Text option, "Use Default Blizzard Font"; This will use the font defined by the global variable, 'NAMEPLATE_FONT'.  This should improve the situation for non-latin charcter sets (this is for you, Chinese, Russians, Taiwanese, and Koreans.. xoxo)

6.1.11
	NEW! Keyword filtering for the Debuff Widget
	- See Demo on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KjGFd0TgvM
	- By Prefix.. Mode for Debuff Widget
		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it just acts as "ALL"
		
	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- Found a bug; The Editboxes contained in my ScrollFrames seem to invisibly extend past the bottom of the scrollframe, which can block underlying UI controls.  I've dropped the editboxes to a lower frame level, which is a hack method of preventing problems with it interferring with controls anchored to the bottom of the scrollframe.  Will attempt to figure out a better solution.
	- Name text coloring modes
	- By Raid Icon modes for Opacity and Scale

6.1.12
	- Fixed Hub/Tank NameTextColor errors
	- Updated description of "Vertical Position of Frame" to "Vertical Position of Artwork"

6.1.13
	- tweaked name color function
	- 

6.1 ...x
Tidy Plates: Crossover (Neon, Graphite, etc. for Friendly, Hostile, etc.)
- Name Text Color, By Elite (or many levels above)
- Text entry box to sliders
- "By Low Health"
- Texture Coordinates for Textures and Statusbar
Add a tag to the icon
UpdateIcon should put the debuff data onto the icon.
One of the data elements should be "special case" in order to handle CC type spells

* Spell Icon Border
* Friendly Group Member Aggro Color
* Reduce Double Calls / reduce context update load
   * widget:Test() Testmode Update() function
* Improve ScaleFunctionByActiveDebuffs and Opacity...
	- Create function within the Aura widget to return if the widget is active
	- test via guid, name and raid icon search
	
Debuff Icon "Create Icon" function, exposed

Statusbar Header Graphic (For multicolor fade effects)
fire an event when a nameplate is shown , hidden or created
- Text Plates	
- InCombat: Does red text still bug?  Test with Pericles
	- Yes, text color only changes when the unit..
		- Is attacked by you
		- The unit health changes
	- Make InCombat a spotlight option?
- Make InCombat a filter option
	- If the combat flag is set
	- if the health is less than 100%

- Filter: Filter Out Unmarked Units
- Make a "Neon Mod" as a independent download
* Checkbox for Aggro stuff: Hide/Avoid mobs that aren't In Combat.  Opacity: Hide if not in combat

UpdateWidget
UpdateIcon

* Spell Casting Colors (int/non-int)
* Graphite
* neon "friendly" style and themecustomization() function

* By Health Warning, By Low Health, Etc (Greater than/Less than)
* Turn on/off Text Only Plate (Dropdown box: Show Health Bars for: Friendly, Enemy, Both
* Friend List Feed?
* Mouseover/Unitid search for cast bar interruptible status

* Threat Widget Colors
* ShowText Option for Threat Line Widget (Allow text for either side of the tugging)
* Healer Hub


* Allow unit.guid to be fed from another source:
	- if unit.guid then GUID[unit.guid] = plate end
	This should go in the OnUpdateNameplate function, I think:
	- if not GUID[unit.guid] then GUID[unit.guid] = plate; ContextUpdate end

* Platelevels for plates(1-100), targets(127), casters(101-120), other?(121-125) 

* Raid_Target_Update should trigger UpdateWidgetContext

Slacker Bear

Cataclysm So Far

Hyjal I enjoyed immensly; It was like the Howling Fjords for me.  The "Regrowth" was one of my favorite parts.  Also enjoyed Deepholm, but that felt a bit small.  Went to Uldum, of course.  It's...  beautiful, of course.  I hate the pygmies.  I won't try to explain it, but I hate them soooo much.  Right from that cut scene at the intro to the zone, I hated them.  My character certainly wouldn't be taken captive my those little runts; He's soloed frost giants 40 times his size in Icecrown, and would certainly not SURRENDER to such a thing.  That pissed me off.  I stewed.

Are the encounters fun?
Do your characters feel special?  Do they feel OP in certain situations?  Do they feel unique?  Talent trees should give players the choice to be OP in ONE area.  Otherwise, it's all the same.  Use your strengths.  Water beats fire, which beats wood... Battlbeasts!
Are the mechanics of a class enjoyable?
5-mans...

Raid accessibility...

5-man regulars should help prep for end game raiding
5-man herics should be end game content, somewhat on par with raids.
5-mans to 10-man regular
5-man heric = 10-man regular
