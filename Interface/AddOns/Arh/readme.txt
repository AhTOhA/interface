* After Survey you press green, yellow or red button to add new
  sector to the HUD (cleared automaticaly on gathering)
* Shows Dig Sites on Minimap and Battlefield Minimap 
* Keybindings and various settings

How to use:

Go to dig site, Right Click last button (spade) to show HUD and
Left Click to cast Survay. Then ROTATE YOUR CHAR, BUT DON'T MOVE in the
needed direction and press colored button according to Survey result.
Move to other location, do same again.
It is strongly recommended to use GatherMate2 then you'll see all
previous or imported dig-points on the HUD.
When using GatherMate2 jump onto fragment before gathering!

HUD:

On the HUD you can also see player arrow in the center and very
small red circle that represents success range. And ofc all colored
transperent overlaping areas that were set by you with colored buttons.
Green compass circle can be removed in settings. it's totaly useless
actually.
