This addon is intended as a replacement for the old Mobile Frames addon. In other words, it makes standard UI frames movable simply by clicking and dragging the title bar. The original addon did not require any additional keybindings or slash-commands to relocate a window. Mine doesn't require any of that, either, and I have no plans to introduce them. The goal is to make moving windows as intuitive as possible.


The following standard frames are currently supported:

All bags, including keyring and bank bags
Mail
Gemming
Reforging
Inspect
Guild
Quest log details
Character
Friends
Quest log
Game menu and all related windows
Macros
Calendar
Quest objectives
Trade
Vendor
Trade skill
Auction
Bank
Class and profession trainers
NPC gossip
Quests
Flight master
Talents
Spellbook
Durability
Casting bar


The following standard frames are NOT affected by the mod:

Item link tooltip (because it's already movable)
World map (this one behaves strangely, so the mod won't affect it until I figure out how to deal with it)


Additional features:

* Window positions are stored per character.

* The first time you open a particular window, the addon will allow the standard Blizzard UI code to place it. Subsequent attempts to open the same window will open it at the last known location.

* Sometimes the initial frame placement is wonky (as in, the window can end up outside of the visible screen area). This happens to bank bags with disturbing frequency. The mod can now prevent that by relocating window so that they can be moved. 


Known bugs and idiosyncrasies:

* I am not sure whether it's my mod or not, but sometimes the search field and the filter button get detached from the trade skill window.

* Be careful when moving the quest objective window too close to the right edge of the screen. If you do that, it might be a bit difficult to move that particular window back to a diffent location.
