v0.4
----

New frames: durability, casting bar. Both are normally invisible, so you'll need to cast something or get some of your items damaged to reposition them.


v0.3
----

New frames: mail, gemming, reforging, inspect.

The item link tooltip and world map windows are no longer affected by the mod (item link tooltips are still movable; the world map isn't).

The mod will now try and prevent windows from opening outside of the visible screen area.
