I am in no way claiming that I have updated this addon or that I created this addon. This is a fan update and should be used with precaution.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

The update was detailed by Morsker on the Curse addon comments. You can see his post at http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/mik-scrolling-battle-text.aspx.

I would also like to thank Zidomo for pointing out Morsker's solutions.

I hope to see Mikord back and willing to sink some time on some new improvements. <3 MSBT!!! Can't raid without it lol.
